## 🌟 What Makes Me Different

### **1. Production-First Mindset**
I don't just write code - I build systems that **stay running** under real-world conditions. Every decision considers monitoring, observability, and failure scenarios.

### **2. AI/ML Integration Expert**
I bridge the gap between **traditional backend engineering** and **modern AI systems**. I understand both the infrastructure needs and the ML model requirements.

### **3. Team Multiplier**
I don't just code - I **elevate entire teams**. I establish best practices, mentor developers, and create systems that make everyone more productive.

### **4. Business Impact Focus**
Every technical decision is tied to **business outcomes**. I optimize for user experience, cost efficiency, and scalability - not just technical elegance.
